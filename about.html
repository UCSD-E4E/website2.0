    <p>Engineers For Exploration is a group of students who develop and use technology to drive the future of exploration. Our projects span aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial environments, opening new perspectives of the planet. With international collaborators in ecology, conservation, and archaeology, we apply remote imaging, sensing, and robotic technologies to extend the limits of human exploration.</p>

    <h2>Interested in Joining?</h2>
    <p>Our research group consists mostly of undergraduate students interested in applying the theoretical knowledge learned in academic classes to solving real-world problems. Many of our students come from engineering majors, but any motivated student can join our group. Engineers for Exploration projects uniquely provide the opportunity to combine hands-on engineering skills with foundational academic research, allowing students to develop skills early on in their careers which are invaluable both to industry engineering positions and in graduate school.</p>
    <p>We are looking for students who are enthusiastic about engineering, technology, and exploration to participate in our research and development projects. Students must be self-motivated and excited about learning new technical skills, no matter their academic backgrounds. We especially encourage students with an interest in photography and film-making to join, since our field expeditions provide extraordinary opportunities for creating exciting media.</p>
    <h3>Get Involved</h3>
    <p>To get involved, please come to one of our general or project-specific meetings listed on the <a href="{{site.url}}/calendar">Calendar of Events</a>. You should also <a href="{{site.url}}/contact">get in contact</a> with the project lead for the project you are interested in.</p>
    <p>Join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/ucsde4e">Google Group</a> to stay up-to-date on our activities.</p>

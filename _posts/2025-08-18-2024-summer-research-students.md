students:
- bio: Aayushka Budhathoki is a Computer Science and Mathematics student transitioning into her senior year at Howard University. This summer, she worked on the FishSense project, implementing Generative Adversarial Networks to enhance the quality of underwater images. She also worked with the Smartfin team, focusing on sensor characterization and calibration. In her free time, she enjoys cooking a variety of cuisines, playing with her cat and competitive GeoGuessing.

- bio: AnMei Dasback-Prisk is a rising senior at UC San Diego, studying Computer Engineering. This summer, she worked on the Acoustic Collar project exploring dataloss and the use of auto encoders to compress data. In their free time they enjoy chilling at the beach, eating food, and walking around outside whether that be in nature or a city.

- bio: Annabelle Chen is a rising junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Amherst College. This summer, she worked on FishSense's new ROV-focused branch, namely focusing on methods for on-device computing and camera calibration for underwater optics. While she loves to think about fish, she also enjoys oil painting, baking sweets, and playing the electric guitar.

- bio: Milo Akerman is a rising sophomore at Brown University, studying Computer Engineering. He has worked in the acoustic collar project this summer, developing the hardware and firmware to deploy low-power embedded systems tracking free-range animal vocalizations. His work focuses on intermittent computing, TinyML, and wireless networking on STM32 ARM CPUs. Outside of the bioacoustics, he enjoys playing guitar, learning cardistry, and perhaps even other things.

- bio: Sijan Shrestha is a rising junior at Howard University majoring in Computer Science. This summer, he has contributed to the FishSense Project, focusing on fish species identification, detection, and segmentation. He is also working on testing a new deep-water exploration camera, which is being integrated with a Rupik Pi to develop an autonomous underwater monitoring system. During free time, he enjoys writing songs and singing with his guitar.

mentors:
- bio: Sean Perry is a first-year Ph.D student working under Professor Ryan Kastner in the Computer Science Department of UCSD and a project lead of the Acoustic Species Identification project. Sean studies all things bioacoustics, from domain shift issue between recording devices to exploratory techniques in unlabeled audio data towards improvements to monitoring of nature and ecology. Towards maintaining a work life balance, Sean also enjoys the wonderful food in San Diego, visiting his family and friends, and getting his cats to chase after an old shoelace.

- bio: OLD BIO, TODO, CHRIS GO UPDATE THIS Christopher Crutchfield is a fifth-year Ph.D student working under Professor Curt Schurgers and Professor Ryan Kastner.  His Masters was in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control.  He is now putting that background to work by developing sensors for understanding the health of our oceans by developing underwater depth cameras with FishSense, a project which he leads.  Through the use of these cameras, he hopes to be able to help scientists monitor the biodiversity of our oceans and the health of the underwater ecosystem.  When not working to help protect our environment, he enjoys a quiet day at home, with his wife and three cats.

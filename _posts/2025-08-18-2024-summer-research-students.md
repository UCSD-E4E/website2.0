- bio: Sean Perry is a first-year Ph.D student working under Professor Ryan Kastner in the Computer Science Department of UCSD and a project lead of the Acoustic Species Identification project. Sean studies all things bioacoustics, from domain shift issue between recording devices to exploratory techniques in unlabeled audio data towards improvements to monitoring of nature and ecology. Towards maintaining a work life balance, Sean also enjoys the wonderful food in San Diego, visiting his family and friends, and getting his cats to chase after an old shoelace.

- bio: OLD BIO, TODO, CHRIS GO UPDATE THIS Christopher Crutchfield is a fifth-year Ph.D student working under Professor Curt Schurgers and Professor Ryan Kastner.  His Masters was in Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Control.  He is now putting that background to work by developing sensors for understanding the health of our oceans by developing underwater depth cameras with FishSense, a project which he leads.  Through the use of these cameras, he hopes to be able to help scientists monitor the biodiversity of our oceans and the health of the underwater ecosystem.  When not working to help protect our environment, he enjoys a quiet day at home, with his wife and three cats.

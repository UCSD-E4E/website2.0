title: Kendall-Forst Marsh Acoustic Deployment!

South of UCSD lies Mission Bay, a popular tourist spot that was once a biodiverse-rich marshland that was destroied though a combination of dredging and the redirection of the San Diego River. However, recent efforts have begun to presreve and restore some of the original habitat, particularlly in the Kendall-Forst Marsh, one of serval biodiversity reverseed managed by the UC Natural Reserve System. This 40-achre Marsh land lies in the northern section of Mission Bay and is a popular spot for migrating birds and two endangered species: "Ridgway’s rail and Belding’s savannah sparrow". CITATIONS (https://ucnrs.org/reserves/kendall-frost-mission-bay-marsh-reserve/, https://nrs.ucsd.edu/reserves/kendall.html#History,-Hydrology,-and-Hydromo). 

Towards aiding in the preservation of this wetland and protecting our avian friends, the Acoustic Species Identification Team at Engineers for Exploration have started conducting Acoustic deployments to the wetland. Efforts led by 1st year master student Wesley Wu and 1st year PhD and Project Lead Sean Perry has resulted into two audio recording devices monitoring continuously for 3 weeks nearby Ridgeway Rail nesting sites and closer to the coastline. The goal: The ability to later create new systems for monitoring bird activity around the marsh and the impact of antroprogentic noise on these wonderful local species that call the marsh thier home.

# Love Your Wetlands Day: February 1st, 2025

Upon Wesley reaching out and connecting with the folks at UC Natural Reserve System and making plans to start investigating passive acoustic monitoring to protect species at the reserve, Wesley and Sean started off by scouting out the Marsh during an open house event as part of Love Your Wetlands Day at the Kendall Frost Marsh. Hundreds of people and organizations were there, out to explore this ecosystem and many people working to protect it.

This image was taken at high tide, so not much of the beach is visable, and the area in particular was quite flooded. There are serval artifical mounds designed to act as Nesting Platforms for the Ridgeway Rail and many other species."

For Wesley and Sean, the main focus was less the event and more on scouting out the area. The team was aiming for a March Deployment and finding a good location for the audio devices were paramount. Espically since we would not be able to deploy closer to the nesting platforms, as in just a few weeks, nesting season would start. As to not distrub the birds, researchers are not allowed near the nesting platforms. However, the team was able to scout out a small penisula that was about 10 meters away from the closet nesting platform across a small river. Notably on this penisula was a small hill that would overlook the area during high tide and a number of small grasses and shrubs that held the ground together near on of these platforms.

Notice in the right image, how close this area is to a nearby nesting platform!"

Upon collecting GPS coordinates of various views of the area, we decided this was a fantastic spot to do the deployment. We could get closer to the nesting platforms without distrubing the bird species and potentially still have recordings sit above the water line. With that, we head back home to start prepping for the deployment.

# Preperation

Two key aspects were needed to get ready to go: Getting approval for the deployment, and getting the equipment set up. Wesley handled the documentation work and networking with the Nature Resereve System to apporove the deployment (which was quite a bit of work!). Sean primarly worked on aquiring recording equipment and setup. 

The devices of interest were the Hydromoth and Audiomoth. Both devices were created by Open Acoustic Devices (CITATION), with the biggest diffrence between the two being the Hydromoth was rated for underwater usecases. The Audiomoth, being less waterproof, would be placed further away from the waterline than the Hydromoth in the upcoming deployment.

With forms signed, devices ready, and permissions granted for the deployment, the team set off early (for a Saturday morning) back to the Kendall frost marsh! Upon arrival, we doned high-vis vests to show we belonged there and borrowed a couple of wooden stakes and began treking down to the marsh. The hydromoth was placed amoung the weeds and grasses closer to the tidal zone and the nesting platforms. Even with a night high tide, we were confident as we dug into the earth to set up the recording device that we would get some great audio recordings from it.

Meanwhile, the audiomoth which we were less confident in it's ablity to surivie water, was placed on that hill as a backup device in case something happened to the Audiomoth.

# The Future

These devices will recording with a sample rate of 48khz and will record continously for 3 weeks. We will return to recover the devices and data. After that? Data processing. The team has been working on San Diego Bird Species based Machine Learning classifers to identify species local to San Diego in audio data. Once we collect the data, we will be focused on labeling as much data as possible to identify species of interest. By working to make this process cheaper to do, Ecologists could potentially use audio recordings as another method for studying these species that are slowly recovering as the original habitat continues to be improved. Then, not only will people be able to love thier wetlands, they will also hear them too.

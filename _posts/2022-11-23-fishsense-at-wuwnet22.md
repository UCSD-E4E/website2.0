Greetings from Boston! Emily Wong, a summer 2022 REU student working on the [FishSense project]({{"/fishsense" | absolute_url}}), traveled to the Home of the Red Sox this week to attend the [WUWNet 16th International Conference on Underwater Networking and Systems](https://wuwnet.acm.org/2022/). The conference took place from November 14-16, with her short paper presentation on November 16. Her 20-minute talk explored the use of pre-existing air calibration techniques for underwater stereo depth calibration, as discussed in "Underwater Depth Calibration of a Commercial Depth Camera". Her research involved a comparison of the depth and length estimates of the camera with ground truth data after performing various methods of calibration in an underwater environment. While none of these calibration methods significantly improved the performance of the camera compared to its baseline value, it helped set the ground work for current depth calibration testing.

Emily was excited to attend her first conference, speak with leaders in the underwater networks space, and see demonstrations of advanced underwater technology. Thanks to the WUWNet'22 chairs for leading an amazing conference, NSF for the funding to conduct the summer research, and the co-authors (Isabella Humphrey, Scott Switzer, Christopher L Crutchfield, Nathan Hui, Curt Schurgers, and Ryan Kastner) for making this publication possible.

We are excited to announce the latest publication for the Radio Telemetry Tracking project. We've detailed the development, testing, deployment, and analysis of the Radio Telemetry Tracking platform and compared it to the performance of other platforms in the context of a field expedition. This provides context for the significant impact drones can have on radio telemetry tracking work, particularly on smaller animals.

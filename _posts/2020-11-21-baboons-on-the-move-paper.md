We’d like to announce the Baboons on the Move team’s first publication.  We’ve detailed an algorithm that allows us to detect motion from a camera with six-degrees-of-freedom.  In our case, we are leveraging a drone-mounted camera hovered at 80m above the animals and applying our home-grown algorithm to detect the motion within the footage.  This allows us to highlight the currently moving baboons within the frame, flagging points for our collaborators to focus on.  Read the full paper here ([https://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/admin/crutchfield2020baboons.pdf](https://kastner.ucsd.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/admin/crutchfield2020baboons.pdf)) or here ([https://measuringbehavior.org/downloads/MB2020-21-Proceedings-Vol1.pdf](https://measuringbehavior.org/downloads/MB2020-21-Proceedings-Vol1.pdf)).  Come join us in Kraków, Poland in October 2021!

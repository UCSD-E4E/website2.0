Even in the era of social distancing, we're doing research and continuing projects!  We want to continue to responsibly provide research and project experience to students, even while working remotely, so we're looking forward to seeing new people get involved and making more progress on our projects.







Our open house/info session will be on Monday, October 12 at 12 pm on Zoom.  Please drop by to hear about our projects and chat with our project leads on how to get involved.

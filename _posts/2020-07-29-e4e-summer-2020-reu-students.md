Fredo is a rising senior at UCSD, and is majoring in Nanoengineering with his focus being in Mechanical engineering and Materials Science. He is working on the Fish Sense project this summer, here he is learning how 3D imaging works and he is working to use depth cameras for the creation of 3D meshes and the characterization of objects. He hopes the skills he will acquire in this program will aid him to be a better engineer in future projects with more to contribute. The goal is that this current project will be used by researchers to characterize fish species from a distance without needing to capture them. When he’s out enjoying himself he has fun gaming, surfing, reading, rock climbing, hiking, and a variety of other hobbies!

David Forman loves creating algorithms, especially with machine learning. As an REU researcher with E4E, he has programmed an interactive interface for ML-assisted image labeling. In an underwater acoustics REU, he made a measure of seabed acoustic similarity, which has defined a paradigm for seabed characterization via classification, soon to be submitted as a paper. A rising senior in physics at Hillsdale College, he has applied machine learning to astrophysics, distinguishing true neutron star pulses from terrestrial noise. He enjoys talking with friends and also performing music on his viola - in orchestra, in quartets, for dances, and regularly for the elderly in retirement homes.

This summer we are hosting 12 students from all around the USA, Brazil, and China, as part of our the 2016 summer REU program. Our students are working on a diverse array of projects, including development of a new underwater 3d visualization system, dynamic path planning for aerial robots, robust 3D coverage estimation, the aerial radio collar tracker, machine learning for bioacoustics, and 3D reconstruction for archaeological surveys.

UC San Diego’s Engineers for Exploration Summer Research Program is an NSF REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) Site centered around multidisciplinary and collaborative student research with the broad goals of protecting the environment, uncovering mysteries related to cultural heritage, and providing experiential learning experiences. Our program is a full-time paid research experience from June 24th to August 30th in which students will work in multidisciplinary research teams to aid scientists from the San Diego Zoo, Scripps Institute of Oceanography, and UC San Diego in tackling problems in fields such as ecology, physical oceanography, and archeology.

During this program, students will create and apply technologies in novel ways to aid scientists in their work, and may have opportunities to accompany these technologies on field deployments around the world. Through these projects, students can expect to learn about embedded systems and software, machine learning, electronics integration, mechanical design, system building, as well as project management and team leadership. For more information, please visit our website at [https://e4e.ucsd.edu](https://e4e.ucsd.edu).

Applications are currently being accepted at [https://e4e.ucsd.edu/apply](https://e4e.ucsd.edu/apply) through February 15. Applications will continue to be accepted through March 30 if positions are not yet filled.

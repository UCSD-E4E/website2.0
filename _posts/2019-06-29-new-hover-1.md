On Jun 27th, Eric Lo, Nathan Hui, Eric Tran, and Emmanuel Gharehbekloo took E4E's newest copter for its maiden flight.  This copter is a FoxTech Hover 1 with a PixHawk autopilot, and will primarily be used to support the Radio Telemetry Tracker project.  Its first deployment will be to the Turks and Caicos Islands this August.

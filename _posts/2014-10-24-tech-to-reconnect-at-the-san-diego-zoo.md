E4E demonstrated some of our remote imaging platforms at the first event in the [Tech to Reconnect](https://techtoreconnect.org/) series at the San Diego Zoo. This lecture series features speakers who have invented tools to help people engage with nature in inventive ways. Our advisor Albert Lin was one of the featured speakers! And one of our alumni and current staff scientist Eric Lo was featured in the Tech to Reconnect promotional video below.

We brought our stereo diving rig, our new TunnelBot platform, and one of our copters to the event to show people how technology can be used to enhance conservation efforts in a variety of different ways.

The event also featured Katie Rast, the director of FabLab San Diego, and Mileece, a sonic artist who works to connect people with nature through art. We were excited to be able to connect with so many people from diverse backgrounds working to promote conservation!

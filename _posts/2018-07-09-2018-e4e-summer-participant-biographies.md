Dan is an electrical engineering student at Princeton University, where he’ll be a senior in the fall. He is working with Rob to develop an underwater depth sensor system for use in coral mapping work being done by researchers at SIO, and looks forward to doing a lot of hands on work. Outside of engineering, he enjoys spending time outside and getting involved in musical projects. Dan has lived in New Jersey for his whole life and his family and friends are very excited to hear about life in California.

Brennan is a sophomore at the University of South Carolina studying Computer Engineering and Math. His academic interests lie in robotics and control systems and he has previous experience with UAV automation in his home institution. He is working with Indira and Zain to use a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) PYNQ board to control a UAV. He hopes this system will be able to accelerate controls on small unmanned aerial systems and allow for faster computing onboard. When he’s not playing with robots, he enjoys hiking, cooking, playing frisbee, and going to the beach.

Robert Barlow is a rising junior at Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering, studying mechanical engineering. Originally from Vermont, this is his first time in San Diego. Prior to this summer, Robert has worked in the field of sUAS, particularly with fixed wing airframes, ranging from fire supression to aerial imagery of sargassum algae in the North Atlantic sea gyre. This summer, Robert is working on developing a standalone sensor system for the 100 Island Challenge at Scripps Institute of Oceanography. Outside of engineering, Robert enjoys rock climbing, backpacking, skiing, playing guitar, and just recently got into surfing.

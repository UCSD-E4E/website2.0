Engineers for Exploration was present to celebrate UC San Diego's CSE Department 25th Anniversary. We had a booth to show off our projects, as well as setting up the balloon for a live demo.

We set up the balloon to float over the Warren Bear, and streamed the balloon's view over a Google Hangout to our booth inside.

Finally, I took some video of the balloon being blown around by the wind to show the balloon's stabilization.

We attempted a structure from motion reconstruction of the Warren bear, but did not have sufficient angles to create a good reconstruction. We will attempt this again with a quadcopter, which is better suited to getting the exact angles we need.

Hereâ€™s our poster from the session:

The Camera Trap Team just got the x10 Ninja Pan-Tilt turret to experiment with. After playing with it a bit, we discovered 2 things: it's VERY quiet, and VERY slow. The quiet part is great for the camera trap, but the speed could be an issue. For long range shots, it should be great though.

The picture above is of the x10 "Ninja Turtle" turret undergoing logic analysis. The idea is that we will replace the antenna and remote control that came with the x10 with our own control system. By doing this, we'll be able to control the turret with the camera trap, giving us another option for the Intelligent Camera Trap's mechanical setup.

2020 Summer Research Presentations





Thank you to the students who contributed to our Summer Research program this year!  It was a lot of fun to conduct research on remote sensing technologies while working remotely!  A huge shout out to the following programs for helping to support our Summer Research program:







  * National Science Foundation Research Experience for Undergraduates
  * UC San Diego Summer Research Internship Program
  * Hiestand Summer Research Scholarship Program






This year was particularly memorable in that for the first time, we were able to support a number of high school students from Rancho Bernardo High School and Canyon Crest Academy!

PhD student and Acoustic Species Project lead Sean Perry was awarded the Conservation Technology Fellowship from the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance!

Primarily focused in the challenges of processing data from Passive Acoustic Monitoring deployments, Sean will spend the fellowship working in the Beckman Center for Conservation Research studying Burrowing Owls from the Biodiversity Research here in San Diego. Current goals are to make it easier to study the interactions between different generations of owls. At the same time, Sean continues to lead the Acoustic Species Identification Team continuing to study new ways of processing and studying audio data.

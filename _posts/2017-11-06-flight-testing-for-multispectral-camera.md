This weekend we spent some time flight testing our new, lighter mount for the Parrot Sequoia on the DJI Phantom 4 Pro. Instead of strapping a heavy USB battery pack on the back of the Sequoia, we're now tapping into the Phantom's battery and using a DC/DC converter for power.Â  This seemed to improve the Sequoia's stability, as the USB battery was occasionally unable to provide sufficient power for the Sequoia and would become unresponsive after a flight.

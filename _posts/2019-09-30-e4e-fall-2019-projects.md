We’re getting up and running again this quarter, and looking forward to getting some fresh faces and making some progress on our projects.







Our open house/information session will be on Tuesday, October 8th at 1pm in Henry Booker Conference room (2512) in Jacobs Hall.  Please come by to hear about our projects and chat with our project leads on how to get involved.







To keep up to date with what we’re up to, please join our Google Group, Slack, or show up at one of our weekly meetings (on the calendar).  [JOIN US]({{ "/welcome" | absolute_url }})

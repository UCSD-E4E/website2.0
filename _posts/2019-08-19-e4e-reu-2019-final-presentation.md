On August 28th, our summer undergraduate researchers presented their progress on the projects they worked on over the summer.  They traveled to Mexico, Guatemala, and Turks and Caicos deploying the technologies that they developed and have a lot of good data and stories to share. The researchers gave a short presentation of their projects followed by hands-on demonstrations. 

Our summer program had nearly 20 participants working on different projects. This presentation overviews these projects, highlights the student work from the summer, and provides demonstrations of the technologies. The specific projects are:  



 	
  * **Mangrove Monitoring** - collecting, classifying, and assessing mangrove ecosystems in Mexico using drones and machine learning. 

 	
  * **Maya VR** - developing a virtual reality experience of Maya archaeological site El Zotz, Guatemala

 	
  * **D-SEA** - building a depth monitoring system to aid in the creation of 3D models of coral reef sites.

 	
  * **Baboon** - creating computer vision techniques to automatically track baboon individuals from drone footage.

 	
  * **Radio Collar Tracker** - developing, testing, and deploying a radio system to localize endangered iguanas in the Turks and Caicos. 

 	
  * **Coral Bot** - augmenting a soft robot that can explore and visualize the inside of a coral reef.

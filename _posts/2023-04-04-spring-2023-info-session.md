Engineers for Exploration is a one of a kind program that develops intelligent systems that aid research in conservation, cultural heritage, and exploration. We work closely with archaeologists, biologists, ecologists, and marine scientists to create technologies that aid them in their scientific research. Applications range from determining population counts for endangered animals and studying animal behavior to capturing large-scale ecological data and visualizing archaeological discoveries. Engineers for Exploration centers around student-led teams who tackle the design process from beginning to end, from planning and prototyping various designs, culminating in deploying the system in the field alongside scientists and explorers. This is a unique opportunity to work on a project with real-world impact for our collaborators. This quarter, we are looking for students to join seven different projects, working on topics such as radio tracking pandas and lizards, detecting bird species using machine learning and sound, monitoring sea surface temperature with surfers, and much more!  
 
If you are interested, please fill out the application online atÂ [https://e4e.ucsd.edu/join]({{"/join" | absolute_url}}). Applications for this quarter close on April 12 at 6 PM.

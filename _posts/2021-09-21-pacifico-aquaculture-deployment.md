On August 26th, 2021, Peter Tueller, Ronan Wallace, and Patrick Paxson deployed a prototype of the FishSense platform at Pacifico Aquaculture sustainable fish farm off the coast of Ensenada, Mexico. During this trip, the FishSense team deployed the fish detection device in a real world environment, where the device was able to be tested fully through a user lens, allowing the team to better gauge and assess where improvements and changes are needed. This is an important step to better understanding the problem space and the needs of the user, giving light to any unforeseen issues overlooked in controlled testing environments. This deployment with Pacifico Aquaculture will open doors to future testing and collaboration with the companyâ€™s R&D department, furthering the development of the FishSense platform. The data we collected came directly from three netting cages used to hold the fish as they grow, and this data will be used to further train our fish detection model. The information and data gathered during this deployment is invaluable, and paves the way for further development of FishSense.

On Friday July 23rd, 2021 two members of the Automated Acoustic Species Identification team, Jacob Ayers and Yaman Jandali, attended the ICML 2021 conference workshop on tackling climate change with machine learning after having had their paper “Challenges in Applying Audio Classification Models to Datasets Containing Crucial Biodiversity Information” accepted. Their paper details the potential of the field of passive acoustic monitoring in measuring biodiversity loss that results from climate change.It also describes the challenges facing researchers using deep learning techniques in getting the technology to a reliable state for field audio analysis.

We've been working on the mechanical design for the CondorCam's shell. The above model is based on a GPS unit currently used to track condors, which was provided to us by researchers at the California Condor Conservation We are currently modifying this preliminary design to better suit the specifications of our system, including optimizing the surface area in order to incorporate a solar energy harvesting solution.

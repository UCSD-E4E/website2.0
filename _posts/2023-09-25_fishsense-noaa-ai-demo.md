FishSense recently had the privilege of showcasing our innovative software stack at the 5th NOAA Workshop on Leveraging AI in Environmental Sciences. During the demo, we highlighted the capabilities of our new FishSense-Lite camera system, which uses AI and laser technology to measure fish length. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to making this demonstration a success!

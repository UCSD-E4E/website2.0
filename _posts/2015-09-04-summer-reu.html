<p>The 2015 Summer Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) Program has come to an end. The 10 week program brought students from several universities across the United States and Brasil to work on challenging engineering projects that require intensive research, reiterative rapid prototyping, testing and collaboration. This unique research experience leads to the development of engineering tools and platforms to assist conservationists, ecologists, and archaeologists in applications ranging from 3D mapping of ancient sites using LiDAR, aerial bird nest detection, tracking of endangered species and behavioral monitoring.</p>

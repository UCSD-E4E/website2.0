We are excited to announce that two of the project leads from the Acoustic Species Identification Team, **Ludwig von Schoenfeldt** and **Tianqi Zhang**, have been awarded the prestigious **Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute Undergraduate Scholarship** under the mentorship of **Dr. Ryan Kastner**! Together with Sean Perry, they are leading efforts to develop advanced tools for bioacoustic monitoring.

The [Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute (HDSI) Undergraduate Scholarship](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/current-students/undergraduate-financial-opportunities/) supports innovative, student-led projects that push the boundaries of data science. This scholarship will enable the team to continue their work on exploring transformer-based architectures, new audio representations, and advanced data augmentation techniques. Additionally, they are developing a desktop application for collaborators, including the San Diego Zoo. The team will be presenting their work at the HDSI Scholarship Showcase in the spring.

This opportunity allows the team to work closely with mentors and develop data-driven approaches to ecological monitoring. Congratulations to Ludwig, Tianqi, and the entire team for their continued dedication and success!

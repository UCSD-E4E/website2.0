On August 2nd, the Baboon project team dedicated a day to label baboons from the drone footage taken by Neil Thomas in Kenya. The software used to annotate these videos is called CVAT and is an approach for labeling baboons for verification of the baboon projectâ€™s tracking algorithm. The annotated data generated can provide researchers an accurate map of the location of each baboon in the troop at any given point in time, giving them insight into the decision making process of the baboon troops. This annotation tool can be used to train a machine learning model for object detection and can also allow scientists to quickly verify that the algorithm has worked well and make minor modifications when necessary.

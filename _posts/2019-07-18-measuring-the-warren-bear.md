How do current mangrove measuring methods “stack” up? Today, summer REU students Christianna Bambini and Alli Busa tested current canopy height measurement tools using PVC pipes. While there are accurate methods to measure trees, in a mangrove environment, canopy height cannot be measured in these ways due to the extreme density within mangrove forests. Here, the PVC pipe method is being tested as a potential option to accurately determine canopy height, which can then be applied as a parameter to determine mangrove biomass.

Engineers for Exploration is a unique research program that develops intelligent systems for research in conservation, cultural heritage, and exploration. We work closely with archaeologists, biologists, ecologists, and marine scientists to create technologies that aid them in their scientific research. Applications range from determining population counts for endangered animals and studying animal behavior to capturing large-scale ecological data and visualizing archaeological discoveries. Engineers for Exploration centers around student-led teams who tackle the design process from beginning to end, from planning and prototyping various designs, culminating in deploying the system in the field alongside scientists and explorers. This is a unique opportunity to work on a project with real-world impact for our collaborators. This quarter, we are looking for students to join several different projects, working on topics such as detecting bird species using machine learning and sound, monitoring sea surface temperature with surfers using custom hardware, and monitoring animals using drones and underwater cameras, and much more! If you enjoy flying drones, making stuff, and learning new things, come see how you might contribute to one of our projects.

For more information, please look around our website. If you are interested, please apply at [https://e4e.ucsd.edu/join]({{"/join" | absolute_url}}). Applications for Spring quarter should be submitted by April 22.

We will also be hosting an informational session on Monday, April 15 at 2 PM in CSE 1242. This will include an opportunity to do one-on-one interviews with the project leads after the informational session, so please bring copies of your resume.

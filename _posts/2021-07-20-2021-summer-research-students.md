- bio: Chris Maldonado is a first year transfer student from Allan Hancock College to UC Santa Barbara who is studying electrical engineering. This summer (2021), he is a part of the Smartfin project team where he is working on data analysis from the various sensors integrated in the Smartfin. He hopes to implement a Kalman filter into the Smartfin in order to produce more accurate and precise data from the sensor measurements; ultimately, doing so would render the significant results that are acquired from the data as more reliable. During his free time, he enjoys exhausting himself in a rigorous distance-running training regimen, practicing photography of many genres, and recently, he picked up the piano and is working on becoming the modern day Frédéric Chopin. He also loves to eat and will accept any eating challenge you propose to him. For reference, his personal record of sushi rolls eaten at an all-you-can-eat establishment is 9 rolls, respectively.

On December 2nd, the Atmel University Program visited UC San Diego for the Tech On Tour (TOT) seminar sponsored by Digi-Key. As part of the tour, Atmel brought their trailer on campus to host the Xmega Robot Lab, a basic introduction to microcontroller based robotics. As a number of our projects use Atmel microcontrollers, we were invited to showcase some of our work by Atmel's trailer. We brought the TunnelBot (ATMega328p), the balloon based stabilized aerial camera platform (ATMega328p/ATMega2560), and our OpenROV (ATMega2560) platforms to show what we've done with Atmel microcontrollers.

In addition to the Robot Lab class, we also had the opportunity to see some product demos featuring Atmel devices in everyday electronics, from microcontrollers to touchscreen controllers. Some highlights include a hand drill with Atmel's CryptoAuthentication and the touchscreen in HP's Elitebook 810 Revolve.

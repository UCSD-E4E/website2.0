Hassan Eid is a rising third-year at UC San Diego, majoring in Electrical Engineering. This summer he is working on the Maya Archaeology project which is helping to provide more efficient and accessible methods for archaeologists to map and document the environment they are studying. Hassan will help develop a robust platform for 3D mapping and test the various algorithms that are used in the process. Alongside engineering, he enjoys watching movies and sports, as well as hanging out at the beach.

Emmanuel Gharehbekloo is a rising junior at University of California San Diego, studying Mechanical Engineering. He has been working on the radio telemetry project designing enclosures for the electronics of the drone using SolidWorks. The designs are tested by using 3D printing and he is part of the 2019 operations to track boas in the Turks and Caicos Islands. He previously helped design a rover that would carry a large payload through rough terrain. He has also filled in the engineering managers role for a coding team, writing a modular code to control the rover and a robotic arm. His hobbies include driving through the Angeles Crest highway for no reason and contemplating going to the beach. His prized possession is an ABBA vinyl he got from goodwill for a dollar.

Natasha Hellebrandt is a rising junior at UC Berkeley, where she is studying Data Science. Natasha enjoys learning about various social justice issues and in her spare time volunteers at Sacred Heart Community Service in San Jose. She is passionate about conservation efforts and looks back fondly on her internship with Forest Fund Co., a Brazilian startup devoted to conservation in the Amazon Rainforest Biome, where she contributed to a riverbank reforestation project. This summer, she hopes to contribute to the Mangrove Monitoring project.

Anh Ngo is a rising junior at UC San Diego, majoring in Computer Science. He is interested in outdoor UAVs and autonomous vehicles, but spends way too much time indoors finding completely unnecessary tricks and configurations to optimize his workflow. He is spending his summer at E4E working on an algorithm to analyze drone footage to track moving objects in order to aid animal scientists in detect and track baboons in Kenya as well as investigating Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO) algorithms to allow archaeologists to cheaply and accurately create a 3D model of the Maya tunnels. In his free time, Anh likes to read while sipping Soylent, crash and rebuild quadcopters on weekends, and dream about becoming a prolific researcher someday.

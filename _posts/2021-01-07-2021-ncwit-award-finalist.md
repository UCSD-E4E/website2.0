Congratulations to Nicole Meister for becoming a finalist for the NCWIT Collegiate Award! This award honors the outstanding technical accomplishments of collegiate women, genderqueer, and non-binary individuals at all levels. Conferred annually, the Award recognizes individuals for their technical contributions to innovative projects that demonstrate a high level of creativity and potential impact.

Nicole's project is Bringing Technology to Conservation Groups by Creating Accessible Mangrove Monitoring and Classification Tools, which enables conservation scientists to utilize state of the art deep learning models to quantify mangrove ecosystems without knowledge of coding or data science techniques. This builds on her work this past summer with E4E on the Mangrove Monitoring project!

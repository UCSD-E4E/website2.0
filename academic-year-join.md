If you are interested, or if you have more questions, please feel free to come to any of our other general meetings listed on the [Calendar of Events]({{ "/calendar" | absolute_url }}). You should also [contact]({{ "/contact" | absolute_url }}) the project lead if you have questions about specific projects. If you have specific skillsets, have a look at our targeted [open positions]({{ "/open-opportunities" | absolute_url }}), and see if you have a skillset we are looking for in particular!

For UCSD students, to get started, please fill out this [Intake Form]({{ "/join" | absolute_url }}).  One of our staff engineers or project leads will reach out to you. If you don't hear back from us, feel free to ping us at [e4e@ucsd.edu](mailto:e4e@ucsd.edu).  In addition, feel free to come to any of the general meetings listed on the [Calendar of Events]({{ "/calendar" | absolute_url }}).

Applications are open year round, however, focused review will occur at the beginning of each academic quarter.

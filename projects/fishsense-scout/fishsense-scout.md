**FishSense Scout** is the newest addition to the FishSense family and is currently under active development. Scout serves as the basis for an automated sensing platform intended for applications such as large-scale ocean monitoring, aquaculture, and other environments where a computer-controlled camera system can support repeatable data collection over extended periods.

Scout is being developed as a flexible research platform, allowing us to explore how onboard compute, automated capture, and standardized workflows can support future monitoring efforts.

### Current focus

Development of FishSense Scout is focused on understanding practical constraints and design tradeoffs for autonomous and semi-autonomous deployments.

* Evaluating computer-controlled imaging for repeatable data collection

* Exploring onboard processing to reduce data volume and support triage

* Investigating deployment constraints, including power, mounting, and bandwidth

* Designing data outputs suitable for downstream analysis and review

### Ongoing work and partnerships

We are actively developing and testing FishSense Scout in collaboration with partners, including NWIC Pacific, to evaluate use cases and requirements relevant to real-world deployments. These efforts are informing both hardware and software design decisions as the platform evolves.

### Status

FishSense Scout is a research and development platform. Capabilities, configurations, and deployment models are evolving as testing continues.

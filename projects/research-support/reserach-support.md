The Research Support Group at Engineers for Exploration supports all research operations within E4E. This includes maintaining compute, fabrication, and research tooling/equipment, as well as developing operational support software, tools and procedures. This group is an excellent way for students to get experience with all of the work that goes into enabling research to occur.

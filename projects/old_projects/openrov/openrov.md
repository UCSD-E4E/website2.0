Engineers for Exploration is working on developing an enhanced OpenROV for underwater research and exploration.

The OpenROV platform is an accessible and low-cost platform for citizen science-based ocean exploration. However, many of our collaborators have observed that it is not robust enough for remote fieldwork, sometimes requiring extensive repairs in the field. However, its small weight, tiny form factor and low cost make it an attractive option for fieldwork in remote locations.

We collaborate with Jim Trezzo at OpenROV to integrate various enhancements into the OpenROV system, including working on an acoustic modem, integration of machine vision cameras, and improvements to the mechanical robustness.

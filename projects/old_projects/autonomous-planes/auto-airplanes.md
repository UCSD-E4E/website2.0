Engineers for Exploration maintains several remote-controlled and autonomous lightweight planes for aerial surveys. These planes are used for wildlife surveys, creating 3D terrain maps of large-scale areas, and other applications

These planes can be outfitted with a variety of sensors, including high-resolution cameras for 3D mapping, thermal cameras for wildlife surveys, and radio antennas for radio collar tracking.

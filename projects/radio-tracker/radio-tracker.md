The Radio Telemetry Tracker project is a collaboration between the San Diego Zoo’s Beckman Institute for Conservation Research (ICR) and UC San Diego’s Engineers For Exploration. We have been working with the ICR and its collaborators to develop a drone to conduct radio telemetry tracking missions. Tracking wildlife radio collars is the most effective way of monitoring animal movement patters, however, this is limited by the speed at which researchers can traverse over the terrain in the area where these animals reside. The Radio Telemetry Tracker project addresses these challenges by adapting new technology to approach this problem in a new direction. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to develop a tool for researchers to do more and better research in less time and with less effort. To accomplish this, our system flies a search grid over a candidate area while recording a large swath of radio spectrum using a software defined radio. Once the drone returns from the flight, we use digital signal processing to extract the frequencies that the radio transmitters are transmitting on, and use a statistical model to determine where the transmitters we heard are. This data is then saved to a GIS (Geographical Information System) file, which ecologists and biologists can then use in their research.

Since the start of this project, we have had the opportunity to use this platform in the field. In a 2015 collaboration with Stesha Pasachnik (San Diego Zoo), we took the Radio Telemetry Tracker to the Dominican Republic to study the rhinoceros iguana (Cyclura cornuta) and the Ricord’s iguana (Cyclura ricordi). Then, in a 2016 collaboration with Jennette Moss (Mississippi State University) and Glenn Gerber (San Diego Zoo), we took the Radio Collar Tracker to Little Cayman to study the Sister Isle’s Rock Iguana (Cyclura nubila caymanensis).

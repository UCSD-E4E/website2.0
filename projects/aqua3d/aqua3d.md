The Aqua3D project aims to design novel underwater depth cameras which are small in size and low power compared to the current, state of the art of stereo video.

This project is in collaboration with the [Simmens lab](https://semmenslab.org/) at the [Scripps Institute of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/).

We are currently focused on working with the [FishSense Project](/fishsense) where we provide them the base for their FishSense Lite Camera.

We are also working with the [Naval Innovation Science, & Engineering Center (NISEC)](https://nisec.ucsd.edu/) where we work on a project called ["Underwater 3D Sensing"](https://nisec.ucsd.edu/projects/index.html).  This project aims at being able to provide tools for three-dimensional underwater mapping and shiphull inspection.  underwater mapping is critical for many naval applications wuch as navigation and object detection.

While 3D sensors are making rapid improvments in out of water contexts, adapting these technologies for underwater use presents significant challenges.  We aim to be able to leverage machine learning and optical imaging techniques to address these challenges.

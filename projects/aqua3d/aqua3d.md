The Aqua3D project aims to design novel underwater depth cameras which are small in size and low power compared to the current, state of the art of stereo video.

This project is in collaboration with the [Simmens lab](https://semmenslab.org/) at the [Scripps Institute of Oceanography](https://scripps.ucsd.edu/).

We are currently focused on working with the [FishSense Project](/fishsense) where we provide them the base for their FishSense Lite Camera.

We are also working with the [Naval Innovation Science, & Engineering Center (NISEC)](https://nisec.ucsd.edu/) where we work on a project called ["Underwater 3D Sensing"](https://nisec.ucsd.edu/projects/index.html).

If you wish to learn more aobut the project, contact [Christopher Crutchfield (ccrutchf@ucsd.edu)](mailto:ccrutchf@ucsd.edu) and [Avik Ghosh (a8ghosh@ucsd.edu)](mailto:a8ghosh@ucsd.edu).

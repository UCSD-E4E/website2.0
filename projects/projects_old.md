While we're always looking for more projects, our members come in, learn a lot, and inevitably, graduate. Projects come and go, but we don't forget them. Here are all the projects that we have worked on, but are no longer active. If you have any questions about these projects, please feel free to contact the former project leads, or contact one of our permanent staff (PIs and Staff Engineers).

# Resume
- E4E is primarily looking for students who want to really dive into and commit to a project
- Highlight projects that you've really delved into and developed for several months
- Highlight any distinctive skills you have learned and tell us what you achieved with those skills
- Double check your resume before uploading

# Projects
We really want to see previous project experience, especially those that you’ve really put time into!

If you haven’t yet had any previous project experience, we encourage you to try another project team, or even start your own personal project. Here are some ideas: [https://go.ucsd.edu/3ty4LX2](https://go.ucsd.edu/3ty4LX2)

We are also looking for people that have a specific interest - you're much more likely to get an interview if you apply for a specific project, as opposed to applying to every single project.

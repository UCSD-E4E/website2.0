  abstract  = {Thereâ€™s an ongoing tension between the preservation of cultural heritage sites and the need for usable land. As a result, there have
 been several efforts to preserve these sites using current advances in scanning, modeling, and visualization technologies- notably
 RGB-D cameras, scene reconstruction pipeline, and Virtual Reality (VR). However, these individual technologies have mostly been
 developed independently, and little effort has been dedicated to integrating them. This paper presents an evolution of an existing
 system for reconstructing and displaying cultural heritage sites in Virtual Reality environments. To achieve this, we develop a pipeline
 to (i) track the cameras using visual-inertial SLAM, (ii) perform a 3D reconstruction using registered depth and RGB data, (iii) facilitate
 loading and displaying the reconstruction in VR, and (iv) create virtual voice-guided tours. We discuss the details of this automated
 pipeline and demonstrate its ability to take an unskilled user from data capture to an immersive virtual tour without the need for 3rd
 party or command-line tools by designing a desktop GUI interface. We hope that this automated scanning and reconstruction pipeline
 will help the digitization and education of cultural heritage sites.},

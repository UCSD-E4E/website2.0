- project: Acoustic Species ID
  title: ML
  description: On the Acoustic Species Identification team we aim to aid our San Diego Zoo collaborators in breaking into the passive acoustic monitoring field. As a preliminary deployment, our collaborators collected over four terabytes of audio recordings from the Madre de Dios region of the Peruvian Amazon. We are working to combine the powers of fields such as machine learning, digital signal processing, computer science, biology, and ecology to parse through and extract statistically significant indicators of ecological health from the world's natural soundscapes that are begging to be heard.
  required:
  - Python (Matplotlib, Scipy, Numpy)
  desired:
  - Pytorch, Tensorflow
  - Linux
  - DSP
  - Git
  - Research Skills

    Engineers for Exploration (E4E) is looking for motivated students to take on a leadership role for our Radio Telemetry Tracker (RTT) team. This role could tie into an undergraduate or master's thesis project, and we encourage students to explore this option. RTT is a multidisciplinary systems project in collaboration with the San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance which aims to improve methods of tracking animals using radio telemetry. This type of animal tracking picks up signals from radio transmitters which have been attached to or embedded in subject animals. Traditional on-foot methods of radio telemetry require researchers to trek through difficult terrain with unwieldy antennae, so we're developing two systems to make the process easier: a drone-based system to fly over the terrain, and a tower-based system to be set up and left to collect data with little supervision.

    We have deployed our system to the field previously, and the project's current goals include designing a new PCB for our payload, redesigning our payload's physical housing, and developing software to communicate with the system's peripheral devices, all to prepare for upcoming deployments. Examples of skills which would be helpful for this role include systems engineering, PCB design, electrical debugging, embedded programming, and digital signal processing.

    We assemble our system with custom sensors to gather the data we need and record it for later analysis. Due to such customization and the multidisciplinary nature of RTT, this project has many moving parts, and the ideal candidate would have some experience navigating such problems of complexity. This role includes the expectation and opportunity to deploy the system you develop into the field in order to track animals and report on results.
  desired:
  - Leadership/Project Management
  - PCB Design/Layout/Assembly/Testing
  - Mechanical Design/Fabrication/Assembly/Testing
  - Digital Interfacing (I2C/Serial)
  - Embedded Linux (I2C/Serial/GPIO/sysfs/networking)
  - Python (pybind11/threading)
  - Digital Signal Processing (STFT/spectral analysis/mixing)
